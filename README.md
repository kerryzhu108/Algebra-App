# Algebra Visualizer
The goal of this project is to create an educational tool for visual math learners by
allowing users to interact with numbers and solve algebraic equations their own way.

## Setup
Only required library is Pygame, run code from either "menu.py" or "maingame.py" 			     						   

## Current features
Highlight box that simplifies selected group of numbers, undo/redo commands, 
custom equations, random equation generator.

## Technologies
The program is being coded in Python using the Pygame library.

## Status
Currently in alpha, very buggy and prone to errors such as miscalculations and divison signs not appearing.
On hold due to school.
