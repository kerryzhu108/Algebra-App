# Algebra Visualizer
Aims to help visual learners with algebra by applying bedmas rules for them as they experiment
with moving different numbers around the equation.

## Setup
Install pygame and sympy or use requirments.txt
Run code from main.py

## Current features
Highlight box that simplifies selected group of numbers, undo/redo commands that can restore deleted sprites,
create your own equations, random equation generator.

## Technologies
Coded in Python using pygame and sympy.

## Status
Very buggy and prone to errors such as divison signs not disappearing or a number's sign flipping back and forth.\
Refactored some code to make it cleaner but fundamental structure still very dirty.\
(sorry, this is my first project and I didn't know how files should be organized)

On hold due to school.
